            <p>Hello! I’m <strong>William Gitau</strong>, a web developer passionate about creating beautiful and functional websites. With a background in both design and development, I strive to build user-friendly experiences.</p>
            <br>
            <p>My goal is to have my photographs linger like a memory that stays with you, so their impact can be felt over and over again.</p>
            <br>
            <p>As a photographer, I can subliminally communicate emotions and feelings randomly hidden in life’s compositions. Many consider me, an artistic poet who uses photographs as his vehicle. </p>
            <br>
            <p>I has traveled worldwide, including Dubai, Chile, Japan, and Alaska, in the name of photography. My photographs are meant to be experienced on two levels — the surface and the visceral.</p>
            <br>
            <p>Unbeknownst to the observer, a thought gently breezes into their minds as they view my photographs. This gentle breeze whisks in and is felt as emotions, perhaps lost memories—maybe a song brought on by the thought of lost love. It’s all there captured in one fleeting moment and is the reason his photographs make an impact.</p>
